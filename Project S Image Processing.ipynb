First we prepare a data frame that contains the filename, tick, yaw, pitch, and the (X,Y) coordinates of the center of either the sun or the moon if present in the image. \n","\n","This is accomplised by using OpenCV to first binarize and threshold the image, converting a colored RGB image into a black and white image in which only the moon or the sun should appear as white due to pixels with brightness below a certain threshold being set to 0. As you can see from the structure of the if statements inside, the threshold is set based on time of day, and edge cases such as facing away from the sun at sunrise, or facing away from the sun at sunset. \n","\n","Contours are found for binary images, and centroids are reported. If an image contains 2 or more centroids (which should never be the case because the sun and the moon are never together in frame) then the image and its file path are displayed. \n","\n","If the sun or moon is present, its (X,Y) coordinates are set to those that are found in the image. If the sun or moon is not present, both coordinates are set to 0. In the second, smaller for loop near the end we append several images which we know the view was directed at the ground and so expect no celestial bodies.
